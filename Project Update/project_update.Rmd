##Abstract:

It is often claimed that diversity brings with it many benefits. One could envision that growing up in a diverse community with exposure to many different cultures and perspectives could expand one's own understanding of the world and better-prepare someone for living in an increasingly diverse country and society. It is our claim hypothesis that the diversity of one's community has wider-reaching and quantitatively measurable effects, and we wish to test this hypothesis.
