Fig. 1. Obesity Rate by Diversity Index of County. Blue dots represent male data, while pink dots represent female data. 
Obesity rates are highest at levels of very low and high diversity.
Obesity rates are lowest at levels of of medium-low and very high diversity.

Fig. 3. Life Expectancy vs. County Diversity Level. Blue dots reprepresent male data, while pink dots represent female data. Here, the trendline shows that life expectancy is highest in counties with low diversity. Conversely, life expectancy is lowest in counties with high diversity. This may be attributed to the fact that counties with high diversity are largely urban, which makes communicable disease a larger risk than in more rural counties. High diversity counties also constitute higher populations of minorities, which generally have lower life expectancies than their white counterparts.
